## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character 'negotiates with the deep'—a modern or fantastical take on the Fisherwife's power.
- Create a memory belonging to Lyra's mother, using sensory details of salt, sound, and texture.
- Draft a letter from Aunt Marva to her sister (Lyra's mother), explaining her philosophy of 'cleanliness as a moral imperative'.
- Imagine an encounter between Kestrel and a modern-day mechanic or engineer, where he explains the marsh using machine metaphors.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Tide-Table Generator' that creates poetic warnings or prophecies based on weather data and lunar phases.
- Create a visual 'Memory Map' of the marsh, where clicking on locations (the cottage, the shingle bank, the reed beds) reveals fragments of story, myth, and character memory.
